                    <h4><b>Who will be carrying out my treatment and what qualifications do they have?</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    All treatments at Studio 32 are carried out by dentists who are specialists. They hold MDS (Master in Dental Surgery) degrees and are experienced in the procedure that they are performing. A policy that we follow strictly at Studio 32 is that of a multidisciplinary approach to any case. So in case you need root canals, implants and a smile makeover, we have specialists to perform each of these highly technique sensitive procedures. That way, we ensure that you receive the best possible care from the best of doctors.<br><br>

                    <h4><b>Will the dental team speak English? If not, will they provide a translator on the day of the treatment?</b></h4><br>
                    All the team members of Studio 32 are fluent in English and a couple of other Indian languages. However, if you need a translator, we can arrange for one on the day your treatment is scheduled. We request you to let us know beforehand, so that the necessary arrangements can be made well in advance and we can ensure a smooth process on the day of treatment.<br><br>

                    <h4><b>Do you have any references or testimonials from previous patients?</b></h4><br>
                    We have a number of testimonials from our patients who have received various kinds of treatments from us. We would be happy to inform you that a lot of these testimonials are on our website. In case you want to speak to any of our patients personally, kindly let us know. We can arrange for that at a time convenient to both of you.<br><br>

                    <h4><b>What are the rates of success, complication, readmission and infection?</b></h4><br>
                    Studio 32 boasts of a team of doctors who have received training from international mentors and are up to date the latest instruments and techniques in dentistry and facial aesthetics. The doctors at Studio 32 have a vast experience of more than 8 â€“ 10 years in their respective specialities, having treated a couple of thousands of patients. You are in safe hands of clinicians who know the procedures to the basic details and also whether you are a suitable candidate for the same or not.<br><br>
                    The rates of success, complication, readmission and infection depend upon a lot of factors. It could depend upon the initial condition of your tooth or mouth or also upon the after care. These will be explained to you before we start the treatment. A treatment plan will be customized to suit your needs to minimize any future complications and reinfections.
                    We comply with international sterilization protocols and have a Class B autoclave to prevent cross infections amongst patients.

                    <h3>  What is tooth whitening?</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teeth whitening is a simple procedure carried out to remove stains from teeth.</li>
                        <li> This process removes the yellowness from teeth and gives a sparkling white appearance to your smile.</li>
                        <li>Teeth whitening can be carried out in the dental office as well as at home.<br>For the home whitening process, special trays need to be made to fit your teeth. <br>The bleaching gel is then
                        placed in the tray which is fitted on the teeth and worn overnight for a couple of weeks. <br>  The in-office procedure takes about 30-40 minutes.<br> A whitening gel is applied to teeth and allowed to stay
                        for the specified time.</li>
                        <li>  Studio 32 provides the advantage of LASER TEETH WHITENING. <br>It is fast, gives better results and is
                        much more comfortable than conventional methods.</li>
                        <li>   Teeth whitening has no side effects and can be safely done once or twice a year.</li>

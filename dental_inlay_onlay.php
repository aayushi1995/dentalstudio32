                    <h3>  What is Inlays and Onlays?</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dental inlays anjd onlays are restorations used to repair rear teeth with mild to moderate decay or cracked and fractured teeth that are not sufficiently damaged to need a crown.</li>
                        <li>Benefits to inlays and onlays in comparison to metal fillings:</li>
                        <li>1. Inlays and onlays are durable —  they’re made from tough, hard-wearing materials which last up to 30 years.</li>
                        <li>2. They help to strengthen teeth by up to 75 percent, unlike traditional metal fillings which can actually reduce the strength of the teeth by up to 50 percent.</li>
                        <li>3. Inlays and onlays prolong tooth life and prevent the need for more dental treatment in the future.</li>

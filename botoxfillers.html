                    <h3>BOTOX And FILLERS </h3> 
                    <br>BOTOX® is a purified protein complex produced by the clostridium botulinum bacterium. Approved by the United States FDA, BOTOX is the world’s No.1 brand in cosmetic clinics, with over 11 million procedures since 2002.
                    <br><br>
                    BOTOX® for cosmetic indications is a simple, non-surgical, physician-administered treatment that can temporarily smooth moderate to severe
                    <br>Forehead Lines
                    <br>Frown Lines
                    <br> Crow’s Feet and
                    <br><br>Bunny Lines
                    <br>It is also approved for usage in treating Excessive sweating.
                    <br>In people from 18 to 65 years of age It is the only anti aging, wrinkle treatment of its type approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA).BOTOX® has been extensively researched and studied. There are 2200 clinical papers to support its safety and efficacy along with 6000 reference papers. It is approved and marketed in over 80 countries across the globe and is being used by millions of satisfied customers.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>How does BOTOX® works?
                    <br><br>Botox relaxes the fatigued muscles, which in turn causes these lines to fade, giving one’s face a relaxed rejuvenated look. Technically, BOTOX® blocks overactive muscles or glandular activity by selectively preventing the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and temporarily inhibiting the targeted muscle or glandular activity.
                    <br>In cosmetic clinics, doctors today are trained to give the right quantity of BOTOX® at the right sites on the face-with the result that even while wrinkles fade away, the client continues to retain his/her natural looks and expressions.
                    <br><br>
                    <br> How long does the effect lasts?
                    <br>One 15-minute treatment few tiny facial injections and within 7 to 14 days there’s a noticeable improvement in moderate to severe lines on your face, which can last upto 4 months . Individual results may vary.
                    There’s only one BOTOX®. Talk to your cosmetic doctor to see if BOTOX® is right for you! BOTOX® can only be administered in cosmetic clinics by a trained registered medical practitioner.
                    <br>
                    <br>What should I tell my doctor before taking BOTOX®?
                    <br> Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you have:

                  <h3> Dental implants </h3> 
                 <br> A dental implant is versatile and can replace single teeth, multiple teeth, an arch of teeth, or secure dentures. The dental implant process involves a simple treatment plan and an easy patient experience, sometimes even requiring less numbing than needed for a filling. Partial dentures can abuse surrounding teeth, whereas dental implants do not require other teeth to properly restore a missing or lost tooth. Dental implants improve chewing capability, restore the comfort, and enhance the smile.
                 <br>   <br> 
                    What are dental implants?  <br>   <br> 
                    A dental implant (or tooth implant) replaces a missing/lost tooth .A dental implants consist of 3 parts: a titanium screw that replaces the root of the tooth, a porcelain crown that replaces the missing tooth, and a piece in the middle (called an abutment) that connects the screw and the crown. If you lose a tooth or are missing a tooth resulting in a gap between your teeth, your remaining teeth, jaw, and bite will become unstable. Dental implants replace missing teeth (fill in the gap) and restore stability to your mouth/teeth.
                    <br>   <br>   <br> 
                    Who is a candidate for dental implants?  <br>   <br> 
                    Dental implants are an ideal treatment option for most healthy people. In most cases, dental implants are a better option than a porcelain bridge. Exceptions to this rule are patients who are long-term heavy smokers, uncontrolled diabetics, and patients who have undergone bisphosphonate treatment. To find out if you are a candidate for dental implants, schedule a consultation visit to discuss all of your options for restoring your teeth.
                    <br>   <br>   <br> 
                    What are the advantages to dental implants?  <br>   <br> 
                    There are several advantages to choosing dental implant treatment. First, the tooth implant replaces the whole missing tooth (crown and root). Because the root of the tooth is restored, the bone supporting the implant remains healthy and strong. Left without a root or implant, the bone will resorb (atrophy) away leaving a defect in the jaw.
                    How do lines form on our face?
                    Aging skin and wrinkles result from a combination of many factors. It’s not just about cellular changes, collagen depletion, hormone loss, or damage caused by free radicals. The hyperkinectic lines that appear between your brows, around your eyes ,on your forehead & on the nose as result from muscle contractions. When you concentrate, squint, or frown, the muscles between contract, causing your skin to furrow and fold. After years of frequent contraction, those wrinkles can linger even after the muscles are at rest.

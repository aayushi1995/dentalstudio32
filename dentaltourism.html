So in case you need root canals, implants and a smile makeover, we have specialists to perform each of these highly technique sensitive procedures. That way, we ensure that you receive the best possible care from the best of doctors.

Will the dental team speak English? If not, will they provide a translator on the day of the treatment?
All the team members of Studio 32 are fluent in English and a couple of other Indian languages. However, if you need a translator, we can arrange for one on the day your treatment is scheduled. We request you to let us know beforehand, so that the necessary arrangements can be made well in advance and we can ensure a smooth process on the day of treatment.

Do you have any references or testimonials from previous patients?
We have a number of testimonials from our patients who have received various kinds of treatments from us. We would be happy to inform you that a lot of these testimonials are on our website. In case you want to speak to any of our patients personally, kindly let us know. We can arrange for that at a time convenient to both of you.

How many times have you carried out the procedure that I am having?
What are the rates of success, complication, readmission and infection?
Studio 32 boasts of a team of doctors who have received training from international mentors and are up to date the latest instruments and techniques in dentistry and facial aesthetics. The doctors at Studio 32 have a vast experience of more than 8 â€“ 10 years in their respective specialities, having treated a couple of thousands of patients. You are in safe hands of clinicians who know the procedures to the basic details and also whether you are a suitable candidate for the same or not.
The rates of success, complication, readmission and infection depend upon a lot of factors. It could depend upon the initial condition of your tooth or mouth or also upon the after care. These will be explained to you before we start the treatment. A treatment plan will be customized to suit your needs to minimize any future complications and reinfections.

Are you regulated by a professional body and do you have to be registered with them?
All Indian dentists are regulated by the Indian Dental Association (IDA). Our professionals are registered with the IDA and are actively involved in the activities and proceedings of the same.

Is the work guaranteed for a certain period of time?
Certain procedures like crowns from a particular company (like Lava, Emax) do have warranties for certain number of years. Some implants can be replaced if they fail under certain conditions. These will be discussed with you prior to making a treatment plan and you will be given options to choose from.

What aftercare do you provide?
As per our policy, once you return to your home country, we will remain in touch with you through emails and if required, Skype and phone calls. You are free to contact us at any time about any problem or doubt that you may have. We will be more than happy to help you.

If there are any complications and I need further treatment, is it included in the initial cost?
Certain treatments are covered in the initial costs and these will be communicated to you before the start of your treatment.

Do you have a complaints system in place? Can I see a copy of it?

                    <h3>  What is Clear Path Aligners ?</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>ClearPath introduces a USFDA APPROVED breakthrough technology which revolutionizes the way we treat malocclusions (straightening teeth).<br> All you have to do is wear a series of clear wafer thin transparent removable aligners, <br>which gently guide your teeth from their present to the desired position <br>to give you the perfect smile you always desired! </li>
                        <li> Our certified ClearPath Aligner specialist will evaluate your teeth and talk about any problems or goals you have for your smile.<br> Once you and your specialist establish that ClearPath is the right treatment option for you, <br>your doctor will take impressions, photos, <br>and x-rays of your teeth that ClearPath uses in manufacturing your custom aligners. </li>
                        <li>You are advised to wear your aligners all the time, except while eating and drinking or during daily tooth care, such as brushing and flossing. <br>Your ClearPath aligners are so clear they are barely noticeable<br> so they won’t have an impact on your day to day life. <br>Aligner by aligner, you’ll be able to see the difference as your teeth slowly adjust and <br> align to your target smile.You’ll visit your specialist periodically for checkups to see <br> how you’re progressing until you eventually have the great smile you’ve always wanted.

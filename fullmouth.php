                    <h3>  What is Full Mouth ReConstruction ?</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full mouth reconstruction or rehabilitation involves the process of rebuilding <br>and simultaneously restoring all the teeth in a patient’s mouth. <br>Full mouth rehabilitation is a highly individualized treatment which involves various treatment modalities<br> to create the correct relationship between gums, bones, muscles, and teeth. <br>
                        With full-mouth reconstruction the entire mouth is restored to a more comfortable bite and less stress in the jaw and neck. </li>
                        <li> The mouth is a complex machine; without a proper bite enormously destructive <br>forces begin to attack teeth. Chewing can become impaired, teeth can become worn, the jaw and neck can become sore, <br>and even migraines can occur. Crowded teeth, poor dental hygiene, age of your teeth, improperly contoured fillings and crowns,<br> non replacement of extracted teeth – all can contribute to this condition. <br>Every time your jaw closes, the damage continues. 
                    </li>
                        <li>Full mouth rehabilitation may include any or all of the following treatments: <br>Root canals <br>
                        Crowns (caps) <br>
                        Dental bridges <br>
                        Dental veneers <br>
                        Dental implants <br>
                        Teeth whitening <br>
                        Fillings <br>
                        Orthodontics may also be employed to help properly position the jaw and align the teeth <br>
                        Gum treatment <br>
                        </li>
